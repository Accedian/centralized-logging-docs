# Centralized Logging for Distributed Systems

This project documents the architecture and implementation of a centralized logging solution for distributed systems with remote agents.

## Project Structure

- `architecture/`: High-level and detailed architecture documentation
- `setup/`: Setup and configuration guides for each component
- `examples/`: Example configurations and code samples
- `diagrams/`: PlantUML source files for system diagrams

## Key Components

1. **OpenSearch**: For log storage, search, and analysis
2. **FluentD**: For log collection, processing, and forwarding
3. **Thanos**: For Prometheus metrics federation and long-term storage
4. **Remote Agents**: Lightweight collectors for remote systems

## Getting Started

1. Review the architecture documentation
2. Follow the setup guides for each component
3. Check the examples for implementation details
